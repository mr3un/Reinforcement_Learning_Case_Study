# Reinforcement_Learning_Case_Study

This is a case study i done in 2022 Fall for Gatech CS7641 Machine Learning Course for ReinforcementLearning.

What is in it:

-Two RL problem:
-Frozen Lake : 4x4, 20x20 with 20% hole probability,https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/
-Tiny Forest Manangerment : Size of 3, 10, 100, 1000, https://github.com/elbecerrasoto/gym-forest-fire

RL style algo to be disscussed:
-Dynamic programming -- Value Iteration (VI), Policy Iteration (PI)
-Q-learning

-Performance and features of these two style of RL was disscussed here.

It require Numpy, Pandas, Openai Gym 26.2, Hiive fork of PyMDPtoolbox(https://github.com/hiive/hiivemdptoolbox/releases) to run.
